`AlgebraicPetri.jl` is a Julia library for building Petri net agent based models
compositionally. This library acts as a bridge between
[Catlab.jl](https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl) and
[Petri.jl](https://github.com/mehalter/Petri.jl). This package defines the
category of Open Petri Nets as described in [[Baez 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05415)].
