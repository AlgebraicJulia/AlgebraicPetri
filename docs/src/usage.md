# Basic Usage

Basic usage of `AlgebraicPetri.jl` has been demonstrated through included
example notebooks:

- [epidemiology.jl](examples/epidemiology.html) - Define a presentation on the
  category of Open Petri Nets that describe epidemiological models, create and
  model a few basic models such as SIR, SEIR, and SEIRD.
- [covid.jl](examples/covid.html) - Extend the epidemiology presentation as
  defined in `epidemiology.jl` to include travel between regions/cities. Use
  this extra functionality to build a multi-city model of the emergent COVID-19
  pandemic.
